The program must accept a time T (in 24hr format HH:MM) and an integer X as the input. The program must update the time T by adding X minutes to it. 
Then the program must print the updated time T in the same 24hr format as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):

0 <= HH <= 23
0 <= MM <= 60
1 <= X <= 10^8

Input Format:
The first line contains T. The second line contains X.

Output Format:
The first line contains the updated time T.

Example Input/Output 1:

Input:
08:15
20

Output: 
08:35

Explanation:
Here, HH-08, MM=15 and X-20. 
After adding 20 minutes, the time T becomes 08:35 So 08:35 printed as the output.

Example Input/Output 2:

Input:
23:50
15

Output: 
00:05

Program:

// Online C compiler to run C program online
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int hrs,mins;
    scanf("%d:%d",&hrs,&mins);
    int t;
    scanf("%d",&t);
    int total_mins=(hrs*60)+mins+t;
    hrs=total_mins/60;
    mins=total_mins%60;
    if(hrs>23)
    {
        hrs=hrs%24;
    }
    printf("%02d:%02d",hrs,mins);
   
}
