The program must accept three integers X, Y and Z as the input. The program must find and print the smallest positive integer N based on the following conditions.

- N is divisible by Z.
-N is not equal to any of the integers from X to Y (where X < Y.

Boundary Condition(s):

1 <= X, Y, Z <= 10^8
Input Format: The first line contains X, Y and Z separated by a space.
Output Format: The first line contains N.

Example Input/Output 1:

Input: 282
Output: 10

Explanation:
10 is the smallest integer which is divisible by 2 and it is not equal to any integers from 2 to 8. So 10 is printed as the output.

Example Input/Output 2:

Input: 5 10 4
Output: 4

Program:

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int x,y,z;
    scanf("%d %d %d",&x,&y,&z);
    int flag=0;
    for(int i=1;i<x;i++)
    {
        if(i%z==0)
        {
            printf("%d",i);
            flag=1;
            break;
        }
    }
    int t=y+1;
    if(flag==0)
    {
        while(t>y)
        {
            if(t%z==0)
            {
                printf("%d",t);
                break;
            }
            t++;
        }
    }
}
